    <p> Until recently, touch-based solutions have remained a standard way of interacting with physical experiences. 
    However, the health crisis is making the world completely rethink the way we interact in public and retail spaces. </p>

    <p>From an engineering perspective, transitioning current screen-based experiences to support touchless interaction is one possible near-term solution.
    Touchless offers the potential for not only safer experiences but also innovating ways to interact.</p>

    <p>Touchless experiences can be deployed for a variety of different use cases, each with their own advantages and challenges. In retail space for example, high foot traffic requires touchless solutions that can distinguish between a user's hands and those of a bystander. While in a museum setting, touchless experiences will have to be robust and adaptable enough to work in dark or unusual lighting conditions. </p>

    <p>V_ is exploring various options for low-touch and touchless physical experiences. This site holds some of these experiments.</p>
