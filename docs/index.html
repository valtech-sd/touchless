        Touchless Experiences

      <br></ br>
      <p> Until recently, touch-based solutions have remained a standard way of interacting with physical experiences.
        However, the health crisis is making the world completely rethink the way we interact in public and retail
        spaces. </p>

      <p>From an engineering perspective, transitioning current screen-based experiences to support touchless
        interaction is one possible near-term solution.
        Touchless offers the potential for not only safer experiences but also innovating ways to interact.</p>

      <p>For this research, we have focused on image-based hand detection. This approach is desirable because the only
        hardware requirement is a video camera and is a cross platform solution. </p>

      <p>Touchless experiences can be deployed for a variety of different use cases, each with their own advantages and
        challenges. In retail space for example, high foot traffic requires touchless solutions that can distinguish
        between a user's hands and those of a bystander. While in a museum setting, touchless experiences will have to
        be robust and adaptable enough to work in dark or unusual lighting conditions. </p>

      <p>V_ is exploring various options for low-touch and touchless physical experiences. This site holds some of these
        experiments.</p>
