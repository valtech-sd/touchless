          <p> Until recently, touch-based solutions have remained a standard way of interacting with physical
            experiences.
            However, the health crisis is making the world completely rethink the way we interact in public and retail
            spaces. </p>
          <p>Our research is showing:
          <ul>
            <li>85% of people will likely head back to stores soon after restrictions are lifted, however most will only
              return to stores with reservations and other precautions that ensure social distancing</p>
            <li>45% of people will likely not be willing to touch a digital screen in a public place following the
              pandemic,
              which means we are at risk of losing almost half of our users right at the onset of our experiences</p>
            <li>The results show that more males than females will be willing to touch a digital screen in public</li>
            <li>Using a personal phone as a controller ranked higher than voice control and gesture control in overall
              level
              of satisfaction (7.8/10), ease of adoption (92% said easy or very easy to learn how to use), and level of
              comfort with using in a public space (7.8/10)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>From an engineering perspective, transitioning current screen-based experiences to support touchless
          interaction is one possible near-term solution.
          Touchless offers the potential for not only safer experiences but also innovating ways to interact.</p>

        <p>For this research, we have focused on image-based hand detection. This approach is desirable because the only
          hardware requirement is a video camera and is a cross platform solution. </p>

        <p>Touchless experiences can be deployed for a variety of different use cases, each with their own advantages
          and
          challenges. In retail space for example, high foot traffic requires touchless solutions that can distinguish
          between a user's hands and those of a bystander. While in a museum setting, touchless experiences will have to
          be robust and adaptable enough to work in dark or unusual lighting conditions. </p>

        <p>V_ is exploring various options for low-touch and touchless physical experiences. This site holds some of
          these
          experiments.</p>
